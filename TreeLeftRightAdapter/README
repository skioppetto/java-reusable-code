Storing Hierarchical Data in a Database using Left&Right method
---------------------------------------------------------------

use a tree as loaded/stored object hiding implementation 

- TreeNode public class and methods
- Test with Mock DAO layer

TODO: 
	- implements JPA and NOSQL dao layer
	- make NodeContainer a built-in class (hide implementation)
	

DAO TIPS:
	retrieve a (sub)tree:
	SELECT * FROM tree WHERE lft BETWEEN 2 AND 11 ORDER BY lft ASC;
	
	path to a node:
	SELECT title FROM tree WHERE lft < 4 AND rgt > 5 ORDER BY lft ASC;
	
	descendants count:
	descendants = (right - left - 1) / 2
